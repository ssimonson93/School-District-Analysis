# Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze test scores from a number of local schoolsâ€™ students in order to find any trends in success that relate to such things as school size, type, and budgets.  This data will help the district school board make decisions regarding funding and other factors in order to assist the students in succeeding as best they can.

# Results
The following results were found during the analysis of the test score data after the erroneous Ninth Grade scores were removed from the Thomas High School data.
* Prior to the removal of the altered test scores, Thomas High School showed students were passing their math and reading tests at an average of roughly 60-70%.  However, after correcting for the 9th grade scores, the data showed Thomas High School students passed their tests 90% of the time or more.
* This increase in passing statistics for Thomas High School put the school at second best in the district with regard to the percentage of students passing both math and reading.
* Replacing the ninth-grade scores for Thomas High School had no affect on the math and reading scores by grade, spending, size, or type for the schools, outside of the scores for ninth-graders no longer being listed for Thomas High School
